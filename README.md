## Overview

Our goal is to produce a multiplayer virtual reality racing game based on swinging to gain momentum. The races will take place in a city of the players choosing. The city will then be built based off of various APIs found online. We will proceed to age the city and destroy it, whilst adding nature the growth of which will be determined by the number of years into the future the user supplies as input.
